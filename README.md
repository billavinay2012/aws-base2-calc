# AWS-Powered Math Web Application

## Overview
This project is a **fully functional web application** built from scratch using AWS services. The goal is to demonstrate how different AWS components—**Amplify, Lambda, IAM, API Gateway, and DynamoDB**—can work together to create a **serverless, scalable, and cost-effective application**.

This math web application allows users to perform basic mathematical operations while leveraging **AWS-managed services for hosting, backend processing, authentication, API management, and data storage**.

---

## AWS Services Used

This project is designed using the following AWS services:

- **Amplify** – Hosts and deploys the frontend application.
- **Lambda** – Handles backend processing and executes serverless functions for mathematical operations.
- **IAM** – Manages authentication and access control for API and database interactions.
- **API Gateway** – Acts as an entry point for the frontend to communicate with Lambda functions.
- **DynamoDB** – Serves as a NoSQL database to store user operations and results.
